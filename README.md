# Heuristic-Checkers-Java
The task is to write a heuristic function for the game of Checkers in java. I did it in Polytechnika Wroclwaska and it can help some others people that have to do same kind of things. We used the minimax search algorithm by means of a heuristic function. We already have the checkers game.
